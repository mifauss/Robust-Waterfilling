Robust waterfilling for parallel Gaussian channels with approximately Gaussian input distributions

For all examples, the inputs are assumed to follow a generalized Gaussian (GG) distribution.

[main_iidGG_betav.m] is the main file for an i.i.d. GG example with varying $\beta$, the order of GG distribution, and fixed non-identical channel gains; and 

[main_noniid_hv.m] is the main file for a non-identical GG example with fixed $\beta_i$'s and varying identical channel gains.
